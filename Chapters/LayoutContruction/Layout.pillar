!!! Basic principle reminder

To define the layout of a presenter you can: 
- define the ==defaultSpec== class side method of your presenter
- or define the method ==defaultLayout== on the instance side. 

Both methods should return a layout for example instance of ==SpBoxLayout== or ==SpPanedLayout==.
These methods will be automatically be called when the presenter is created.
