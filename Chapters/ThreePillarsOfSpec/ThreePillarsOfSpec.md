## The fundamentals of Spec (Draft)@cha_fundamentals_of_specstatus: should be revisited for Spec2In this chapter we revisit the key aspects of Spec and put the importantcustomization points of its building process in perspective.### User interface building: a compositionA key aspect of Spec is that all user interfaces are constructed through the reuse and composition of existing user interfaces.To allow this, defining a user interface consists of defining the _model_ of the user interface, and _not_ the user interface elements that will be shown on screen.These UI elements are instantiated by Spec, taking into account the underlying UI framework.In the end, it is the composition of the model and the UI elements that makes up the resulting user interface that is shown.This also explains the name of the root component of Spec: since all UIs are constructed through _composition_ of other UI's, and it is sufficient to define the _model_ to define the UI, the root class of all UIs is named `SpPresenter`.Consequently, to define a new user interface, a subclass of `SpPresenter` needs to be created.Considering the construction and orchestration of the different widgets in a user interface, Spec is inspired by the Model-View-Presenter pattern. The model that is defined in Spec corresponds to a presenter in the MVP triad. Fundamentally, it is built around three concerns that materialize themselves as the following three methods in `SpPresenter`:- `initializePresenters` treats the widgets themselves- `connectPresenters` treats the interactions between widgets- `defaultSpec` treats the layout of the widgetsThese methods are hence typically found in the model for each user interface.In this chapter we describe the finer points of each method and how these three work together to build the overall UI.### The _initializePresenters_ method@sec_initializeWidgetsThe method `initializePresenters` instantiates, saves in instance variables, and partially configures the different widgets that will be part of the UI.Instantiation of the models will cause the instantiation and initialization of the different lower-level user interface components, constructing the UI that is shown to the user.A first part of the configuration of each widget is specified here as well.This focus in this method is to specify what the widgets will look like and what their self-contained behavior is.The behavior to update model state, e.g., when pressing a `Save` button, is described in this method as well.It is explicitly _not_ the responsibility of this method to define the interactions _between_ the widgets.In general the `initializePresenters` method should follow the pattern:- widget instantiation- widget configuration specification- specification of focus orderThe last step is not mandatory but _highly_ recommended.Indeed, without this final step keyboard navigation will not work reliably.!!note Specifying the method `initializePresenters` is mandatory, as without it the UI would have no widgets.#### Widget instantiationThe instantiation of the model for a widget can be done in two ways: through the use of a creation method or through the use of the `instantiate:` method.- Considering the first option, the framework provides unary messages for the creation of all basic widgets. The format of these messages is `new[Widget]`, for example `newButton` creates a button widget, and `newList` creates a list widget. The complete list of available widget creation methods can be found in the class `SpPresenter` in the protocol `widgets`.- The second option is more general: to reuse a `SpPresenter` subclass \(other than the ones handled by the first option\) the widget needs to be instantiated using the `instantiate:` method. For example, to reuse a `MessageBrowser`  widget, the code is `self instantiate: MessageBrowser.`### Defining UI Layouts@sec_layoutmethodWidget layout is defined by specifying methods that state how the different widgets that compose a UI are placed.In addition, it also specifies how a widget reacts when the window is resized.As we will see later, these methods can have different names and are subject to a specific lookup process.A layout method is placed at the class side because it typically returns a value that is the same for all the instances.Put differently, typically all the instances of the same user interface have the same layout and hence this can be considered as being a class-side accessor for a class variable.!!note Specifying a layout method is mandatory, as without it the UI would show no widgets to the user.#### Having multiple layouts for a widgetFor the same UI, multiple layouts can be described, and when the UI is built the use of a specific layout can be indicated. To do this, instead of calling `openWithSpec` \(as we have done until now\), use the `openWithSpec:` message with the name of the layout method as argument. For example, consider the following artificial example of a two button UI that has two different layout methods:```SpPresenter << #TwoButtons	slots: {#button1 . # button2} ; 	package: 'Spec-BuildUIWithSpec'``````TwoButtons >> initializePresenters	button1 := self newButton.	button2 := self newButton.	button1 label: '1'.	button2 label: '2'.	self focusOrder		add: button1;		add: button2``````TwoButtons class >> buttonRow		^SpBox newLeftToRight		add: #button1; add: #button2;		yourself``````TwoButtons class >> buttonCol	^SpBoxLayout newTopToBottom		add: #button1; add: #button2;		yourself```This UI can be opened in multiple ways:- `TwoButtons new openWithLayout: TwoButtons buttonRow` places the buttons in a row.- `TwoButtons new openWithSpec:  TwoButtons buttonCol` places them in a column.### Specifying a layout when reusing a widgetHaving multiple layouts for a widget implies that there is a way to specify the layout to use when a widget is reused.Until now, we have used the `add:` message to add a widget to a layout.This uses the mechanism of `open` to determine the layout of the widget that is being reused.To use an alternative layout for the widget that is being reused, use the `add:withSpec:` message.It takes as extra argument the name of the layout method to use, as we show below:```SpPresenter subclass: #TBAndListH	instanceVariableNames: 'buttons list'	classVariableNames: ''	package: 'Spec-BuildUIWithSpec'``````TBAndListH >> initializePresenters	buttons := self instantiate: TwoButtons.	list := self newList.	list items: (1 to: 10).	self focusOrder add: buttons; add: list.``````TBAndListH >> initializeWindow: aWindowPresenter	aWindowPresenter title: 'SuperWidget'``````TBAndListH >> defaultLayout	^ SpBoxLayout 		newTopToBottom			add: #buttons; 			add: #list;			yourself```This `TBAndListH` class results in a  **SuperWidget** window as shown in Figure *@fig_alternativeButton@*. It reuses the `TwoButton` widget, and places all three widgets in a horizontal order because the `TwoButton` widget will use the `buttonRow` layout method.![Screen shot of the UI with buttons placed horizontally](figures/alternativeButton.png width=50&label=fig_alternativeButton)Alternatively, we can create `TBAndListV` class as a subclass of `TBAndListH` and only change the `defaultLayout` method as below. It specifies that the reused `buttons` widget should use the `buttonCol` layout method, and hence results in the window shown in Figure *@fig_SuperWidget@*.![Screen shot of the UI with buttons placed vertically](figures/SuperWidget.png width=50&label=fig_SuperWidget)```TBAndListH << #TBAndListV	package: 'Spec-BuildUIWithSpec'```THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE```TBAndListV >> defaultLayout	^ SpBoxLayout 			add: #buttons withSpec: #buttonCol; add: #list;			yourself```### The _connectPresenters_ method@sec_initializePresenterThe method `connectPresenters` defines the interactions between the different widgets.By connecting the behaviors of the different widgets it specifies the overall presentation, i.e., how the overall UI responds to interactions by the user.Usually this method consists of specifications of actions to perform when a certain event is received by a widget.The whole interaction flow of the UI then emerges from the propagation of those events.**Note** The method `connectPresenters` is the only optional method for a Spec UI.In Spec, the different UI models are contained in value holders, and the event mechanism relies on the announcements of these value holders to manage the interactions between widgets.Value holders provide the method `whenChangedDo:` that is used to register a block to perform on change and the method `whenChangedSend: aSelector to: aReceiver` to send a meessage to a given object.In addition to these primitive methods, the basic widgets provide more specific hooks, e.g., when an item in a list is selected.### ConclusionIn this chapter we have given a more detailed description of how the three fundamental methods of Spec: `initializePresenters`, `defaultSpec` and `connectPresenters` are each responsible for a different aspect of the user interface building process. We also discussed in detail the ability to use different layout methods and how the lookup of layout methods is performed.Although reuse is fundamental in Spec, we did not explicitly treat it in this chapter. Instead we refer to the previous chapter for more information.
