Chapter Case study one

- needs reading
	- can you check the vocabulary (subpresenter)
	-  we should decide for the instance variable names pointing to subpresenters.-
	And potentially revisit the code 
-  needs transmission explanation,
- Style (I have the impression that I understand)
- GTK 
- conclusion(I will write it)

For now I will not touch it except the conclusion and focus on looking at what we have. 

About instance variable names

testSelectingOneFilmDisplaysIt

	| list |
	list := ImdbFilmListPresenter new.
	list openWithSpec.
	self assert: list detail nameText text isEmpty. 
	list filmList clickAtIndex: 1.
	self deny: list detail nameText text isEmpty. 


To me presenter instance variable should be named ending with presenter (because they are subpresenters)
this way we can have shortcut to access the data inside. 

testSelectingOneFilmDisplaysIt

	| list |
	list := ImdbFilmListPresenter new.
	list openWithSpec.
	self assert: list detailPresenter namePresenter text isEmpty. 
	listPresenter filmListPresenter clickAtIndex: 1.
	self deny:  list detailPresenter namePresenter isEmpty. 

This shows that in fact we should write


testSelectingOneFilmDisplaysIt

	| list |
	list := ImdbFilmListPresenter new.
	list openWithSpec.
	detail := list detailPresenter.
	self assert: detail namePresenter text isEmpty. 
	list filmListPresenter clickAtIndex: 1.
	self deny:  detail namePresenter isEmpty. 

This way there is no confusion we know about what we are talking. 
Once we agree I will rewrite all the chapter.
Because this is important that the book shows good practices.
