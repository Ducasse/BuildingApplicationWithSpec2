Here are some guidelines about writing style and spelling that resulted from discussion among St√©phane and Koen.

* Write "backend", not "back-end" or "back end".
* Write "subpresenter", not "sub-presenter".
* Methods without comment have an empty line after the method selector.
* Methods do not have a period on the last line.
* Do not put a space before a semicolon in a cascaded message.
* Write "Pharo image", not "Pharo Image.
* Do not use protocol references because they are not useful and may change.
* Write "Section 6.1", not "section 6.1".
* Write "Figure 6-2", not "figure 6-2".
* Do not use a prefix "Sp" for example class names because the prefix is reserved for Spec classes.
* Start a note with "**Note.**".
